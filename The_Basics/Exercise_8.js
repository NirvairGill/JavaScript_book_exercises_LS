// Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

var foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
foo.length;  // returns 3
foo[3];      // No, We are not trying to access the value here instead we re trying to define a value at index 3.Right now it is 'undefined.
