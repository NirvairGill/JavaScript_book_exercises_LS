/*
What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Answer: Exception handling is used when there is an expected error occurs in the code. Through exception handling, One can bypass 
that error so that rest of the code gets executed. It prevents the code from getting stuck or failed.
Exception handling is the process through which we can handle errors in a manageble and predictable way.
